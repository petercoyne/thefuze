					You've gotta remember the late seventies and early eighties - because a fierce lot can't. The whole Galway of the Vibes thing birthing free-range students from its universal Cellar Bar, Lounge or Downstairs. Pre-conscious consciousness at its purest. Seven pints and a glass of Guinness. Two pints of Smithwicks and a pint of Harp, Sean, please (to dull the stench of corruption outside). And while you're at it, four Black Russians.
				</div>
				<p class="mb-4">And love was all around. Love of the truths shared in rocking the foundations. Coming, going, starting to leave. All the time trying to be faithful to an unhappy country.</p>
				<p>And the band became all. Careers and studies were abandoned. PA, lights and instruments leased. Engineers and roadies hired (and highered - if you'll excuse the expression). The ballrooms of Ireland throbbwed to one, last capacity crowd. Summer of eighty-one and Sunday Morning was happening ten times a day on Radio 2. The lads gigging six nights a week from Donegal to Dublin.</p>

				<p>
					<span class="uppercase text-gray-300 font-bold">TALENT WAS ALSO OBVIOUS</span> when the band
					with-no-name gave an impressive performance.
					Loud, and with attack, these are a lively bunch,
					especially Coyne, who pranced, danced and leaped
					about the place, and generally dominated the
					proceedings. They sang three original songs,
					"Invasions (Bowie influence?), 'Moonlight
					And Roses' and 'Don't You Touch Me', but helped them
					go down with The Jags 'I Got Your Number' and
					Steve Millar's classic 'Swingtown.'
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4">
					Afterwards I met up with this nameless group,
					three of whose members are in UCG. I was told that
					this was their first public appearance and that
					they'd only gotten together for this concert in the
					past few days. They introduced themselves as Mike
					Staunton, bass, John Fitzpatrick, keyboards, Dave
					Fitzgerald, lead guitar, Paul Gaughan rhythm guitar,
					Mike Arrigan, drums and percussion and how could
					we forget?, Pat 'super' Coyne, lead singer. This
					band has potential, only time will tell of their
					commitment. Will a UCG rock band emerge?"

					The Fuze set the Carousel alight on Friday night with

					deservingly scooped the Â£1,000 prize and recording

				<p>
					<span class="uppercase text-gray-300 font-bold">ON THEIR FIRST</span> excursion outside Galway The Fuze walked away with first prize at the Tramore Band Competition which, among other things, landed them a record deal with Mulligan Records. On their second jaunt away from home they walk away with the prize for the best Dublin debut by any band, earning them this 'rave' review and probably the kiss-of-death. Together since November 79 they have established a very individual sound with definite influences from The Rats, U2 and even Madness in 'I Am A Soldier. Pat Coyne's lyrics and vocal style revealed considerable potential,
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4">
					especially when joined on vocals by guitarist Paul Gaughan. John Fitzpatrick's keyboards add a lot of colour and ideas to the sound especially on their upcoming single 'Stone Age Man. The even superior 'It's A Sunday Morning' is more typical of their overall modern Bowie influenced style, which can keep you dancing while listening to subtle underpinnings and off-beat themes. The Fuze have ideas and ability in abundance. Watch them go."

				<p class=" leading-6">
					<span class="uppercase text-gray-300 font-bold">THE FUZE IS LIT.</span> The westâs newest band is all set for itâs debut appearence on the ballroom circuit on Sunday night next, March 1st. The zealous new five-piece have been achieving quite a reputation for itself in the past fifteen months, and their first single âStone Age Manâ is due for release this week. Describing themselves a âpop/new waveâ group, they will now include more covers along with their original material to suit the wider appeal of the ballroom circuit. Some weeks ago the boys made their debut on RTEâs âAnything Goesâ and Radio 2 rockster Dave Fanning has featured The Fuze on his radio show on numerous
					occasions. Now that The Fuze is lit, just wait for the explosion!

			<p class="px-8 text-md my-12 leading-6"><Photo description="The Fuze" src="/images/1981.webp" align="left"/>With the departure of guitarist Dave Fitzgerald to study art, the now-five-piece Fuze launch themselves on an unsuspecting ballroom circuit. Our heroes adopt a suitably serious pose to mark the occasion while neither John Fitz nor Stan betrays any unusual nervousness at the prospect of âdebutingâ in their home town<br/><br/></p>

			<Review author="RTE Guide" date="July 1981">
				<p>
					ITâS A SUNDAY MORNING. I remember being impressed with the last single from The Fuze and the same applies here. Written by the bandâs lead vocalist Pat Coyne and bassist Mike Staunton, the song is a strong rock number that has that distinctive sound made by many Irish bands of this type. Is a definite Irish sound emerging? The Fuze have been touring Ireland for the past few weeks and you should catch their live act...				</p>

				<p>
					I RECALL SEEING A VIDEO of this song (âItâs A Sunday Morningâ) on âAnything Goesâ and being struck not just by the power and pop-sensibility of the song, but also by the fact that here was an example of a very rare species â an Irish band singing about a uniquely Irish situation. The video showed the band standing around at the back of a church, while a priest spouted fire and brimstone and thumped his bible on the pulpit.

						Described by the band as a song <b>âabout what every young fellow in the West of Ireland feels when heâs called out of bed by his mother on a Sunday morningâ</b>, âItâs A Sunday Morningâ is well received by the critics. Hotpress states <b>âbass and drums arenât as blunt and brusque for Fuze-pop as in comparable British productions but they compensate with a light feathery touch on the keyboard melody lines. Almost a water-ice.â</b> It tops out at 14 in the charts, helped along its way by a music video (a new marketing concept) directed by RTÃâs Bob Collins
